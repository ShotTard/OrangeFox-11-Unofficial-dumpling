NOTE: I compiled this recovery for my own personal use, so I won't be providing any support. Nor do I guarantee that I'll continue to maintain it.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

The difference between the "noencrypt" and "encrypted" is that this version (encrypted) has the following build variables DISABLED: "OF_TWRP_COMPATIBILITY_MODE" and "OF_FORCE_DISABLE_DM_VERITY_FORCED_ENCRYPTION".
WARNING: As I don't intend to encrypt my phone, this (encrypted) version is completely untested, as in it has never been flashed to a device.
