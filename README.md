NOTE: I compiled this recovery for my own personal use, so I won't be providing any support. Nor do I guarantee that I'll continue to maintain it.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

The difference between the "noencrypt" and "encrypted" is that this version (noencrypt) has the following build variables enabled: "OF_NO_TREBLE_COMPATIBILITY_CHECK" and "OF_FORCE_DISABLE_DM_VERITY_FORCED_ENCRYPTION".
